# Enhanced A2A Protocol Demo

This enhanced demo demonstrates **ALL** communication types and features of the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol. Unlike the basic demo which shows only a few communication types, this comprehensive demo showcases every single aspect of the A2A protocol.

## 🚀 What This Demo Covers

### **RPC Methods** (All A2A Protocol Methods)
- ✅ `message/send` - Synchronous message sending
- ✅ `message/stream` - Streaming message sending with Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- ✅ `tasks/get` - Task status queries
- ✅ `tasks/cancel` - Task cancellation
- ✅ `tasks/pushNotification/set` - Push notification configuration
- ✅ `tasks/pushNotification/get` - Push notification retrieval
- ✅ `tasks/resubscribe` - Resubscribe to task updates

### **Task States** (All Possible States)
- ✅ `submitted` - Task received, not yet started
- ✅ `working` - Task is actively being processed
- ✅ `input-required` - Agent requires further input from user/client
- ✅ `completed` - Task finished successfully
- ✅ `canceled` - Task was canceled
- ✅ `failed` - Task failed due to an error
- ✅ `unknown` - State cannot be determined

### **Event Types** (All A2A Events)
- ✅ `TaskStatusUpdateEvent` - Status change events
- ✅ `TaskArtifactUpdateEvent` - Artifact update events

### **Content Types** (All Message/Artifact Parts)
- ✅ `TextPart` - Text content
- ✅ `FilePart` - File content (with base64 encoding)
- ✅ `DataPart` - Structured data (forms, JSON)

### **Advanced Features**
- ✅ **Streaming Responses** - Real-time updates via SSE
- ✅ **Push Notifications** - Webhook-based notifications
- ✅ **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error scenarios
- ✅ **Long-running Tasks** - Progress updates and status tracking
- ✅ **Input Requirements** - User interaction scenarios
- ✅ **Task Cancellation** - Graceful task termination
- ✅ **File Upload/Download** - Binary file handling
- ✅ **Structured Data** - Form processing and JSON data
- ✅ **Artifact Generation** - Multiple artifact types
- ✅ **State Transitions** - Complete task lifecycle
